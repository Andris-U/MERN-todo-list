# MERN-todo-list
Todo list built using MongoDB, Express, React and Node (MERN)

Simple todo list... yes, I know. Another one. But wait! This one was a cool little project to test out some of the new features in React, including the Context API to create Redux-like structure through a global store, and <em>Hooks!</em> So much fun with them, and when used along with await/async functions you feel like you live in the future.

To run it just clone and use "npm run server" on the main directory, and "npm start" on the client's directory.

NOTES: 

I've included a key to my AtlasDB cluster, so if you test the app please remember that all 'todos' will persist unless you delete them.

Also, I'm pretty sure IE cannot handle await/async functions, so in the very rare case someone's using it (...why, though?) be aware that it might break.
